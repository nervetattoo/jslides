There exists some js keynote/presentation tools like S5 and slidy, but i found these
tools to be very lacking when i was about to write an introduction to jQuery.
Now, obviously it doesnt make much sense to write js/html presentations
in anything but a browser, and you dont want to write the entire presentation from the ground
up.

What S5 and Slidy is lacking that i wanted to add was:
* Autoformatting of code
* Being able to add a piece of js that you can run, as well as display in a formatted manner
* A visual logger
* Slide transitions
* List transitions
* Mini view of all slides
* Configurable
* Bookmarkable
* Autoplay
