There exists some js keynote/presentation tools like S5 and slidy, but i found these
tools to be very lacking when i was about to write an introduction to jQuery.
Now, obviously it doesnt make much sense to write js/html presentations
in anything but a browser, and you dont want to write the entire presentation from the ground
up.

What S5 and Slidy is lacking that i wanted to add was:
* Autoformatting of code
* Being able to add a piece of js that you can run, as well as display in a formatted manner
* A visual logger
* Slide transitions
* List transitions
* Mini view of all slides
* Configurable
* Bookmarkable
* Autoplay

PROGRESS

= Session #1 = DONE
The easy stuff really
* Paginate between slides (20 min done)
* Dont allow going to non existant slide (10 min done)
* Change title for each slide (5 min done)
* Allow jumping directly to slide (7 min done)
* One basic transition between slides (20 min done)

= Session #2 =
Seems an unlikely goal, i fear i might just get one done
* Syntax highlighting (40 minutes)
* JS code triggering and linking to syntax highlighting (20)

= Session #3 =
* Incremental data inside slides (one bullet point pr click etc) (20 min)
* Footer with x/y slides and "help" + copyright (15 min)
* Sliding transitions (10 min)
* Time for session#2 leftovers (15 min)
